<h1>The Internet</h1>
<p>
    The Internet began in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the 1960s were large and immobile,<br>
    and to make use of the information stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the computer's location or send the computer's<br>
    magnetic tapes through the traditional postal system.<br>
    Internet is a world-wide global system of interconnected computer networks.Internet uses the standard Internet Protocol <b>TCP/IP</b>.<br>
    Every computer in internet is identified by aunique <b>IP</b> address.<b>IP</b> Address is a unique set of numbers such as <mark><ins>110.22.33.114 </ins></mark> which identifies a<br>
    computer location. <br>
    A computer's private <strong>DNS</strong> domain name server is used to give a name to an <b>IP</b> address so that a user can locate a computer by name.<br> 
    For example, 
    the <strong>DNS</strong> server will resolve the name <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" >http://www.yahoo.com</a> to a specific <b>IP</b> address to uniquely identify the computer on which the website is hosted.<br>
    The Internet is available to every user all over the world.
    The Internet began in the United States more than 50 years ago as a government weapon in the Cold War.<br> 
    For years, scientists and researchers have used it to communicate and share data with each other. Today, we use the Internet for almost everything, and for many people,<br>
    it would be impossible to imagine life without it. Another catalyst in shaping the Internet was the outbreak of the Cold War. The Soviet launch of Sputnik prompted the <br>
    US Department of Defense to consider ways in which information could be released even after a nuclear attack. This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET <br>
    (Advance Research Projects Agency Network), the network that eventually evolved into what we now know as the Internet. ARPANET has been a huge success,<br>
    but membership is limited to some academic and research institutions that have contracts with the Department of Defense. <br>
    In response, other networks were created to provide information exchange.<br>
    January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Before that, different computer networks did not have a standard way to communicate with each other. <br>
    A new communications protocol called Transport Control Protocol/Working over the Internet <b>TCP/IP</b> has been created. <br>
    This allowed different types of computers on different networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network were officially changed to the <b>TCP/IP</b> <br>
    standard on January 1, 1983, hence the birth of the Internet. All networks can now be linked into a global language.

<h2>Who invented the internet?</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet was not invented by anyone. When networking technology was first developed, a few scientists and engineers pooled their research together to create the ARPANET.<br>
        Later, the innovations of other inventors paved the way for the Web as we know it today.

        <dt><b>PAUL BARAN (1926-2011)</b></dt>
        <dd>An engineer whose work overlapped with ARPA research. In 1959, he joined an American think-tank, the RAND Corporation, and was asked to research how the US Air Force would <br>
            control its fleet in the event of a nuclear attack. In 1964 Baran proposed a communications network without a central command point. If one point is destroyed, all remaining points will <br>
            still be able to communicate with each other. This is called a distributed network.</dd><br><br>
        <dt><b>LAWRENCE ROBERTS (1937-2018)</b></dt>
        <dd>Chief Scientist at ARPA, responsible for developing computer networks. Paul Baran's idea impressed Roberts, and work began on a distributed network.</dd><br><br>
        <dt><b>BOB KAHN (1938-) AND VINT CERF (1943-)</b></dt>
        <dd>American computer scientists who developed TCP/IP, the set of protocols that govern how data travels across a network. This helped the ARPANET evolve into the Internet we use today. <br>
            Vint Cerf is credited with the first written use of the word "internet".
            When asked to explain my role in creating the Internet, I generally use the example of a city. <br>
            I helped build roads - the infrastructure that gets things from point A to point B.
